Fridge Butler
Description:
Fridge Butler is an app that helps you keep your kitchen organized! This app lets you keep track of what items you have in your fridge, and lets you know before they go bad. You can also keep a grocery list when you go shopping, and when you buy them you can add them into your fridge. Fridge Butler also lets you save recipes you like, and find recipes based on what you have in your fridge.

As a user…

- (Optional: If I don’t want to specify an expiration date, I will automatically have one set that’s proportional to what kind of food I am adding (ex. produce expires before bread))
- My fridge will send me an email two days before my groceries expire
